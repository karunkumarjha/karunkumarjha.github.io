They can't see her... but I can, my mom.

When she asks me, "kaisa raha din?"
I reply - "thakaan bhara".

Then she asks - "khaana khaya?"
I say - "nai, maa"

And she replies with a smile "aao mai apne hath se khila du".

I lie in her lap while she rolls her fingers through my hair. It feels so calm and soothing.

She often says - "chote chote kaam khud karna seekho, kab tak mai rahungi?"

I reply "muje chor k kahan jaogi, jahan jaogi mujhe paogi."

She chuckles and kisses my forehead. I can feel the moist skin.

Then, in her ever-so-calm voice, she says - "tum hamesha mujhe apne paas paoge".

After this, I sleep in my sleep... and when I wake up, I realise they're right, she's no more.

She was just there for four hours with me when I was born... my mom.
