It's been the middle of night.
Lights are still burning bright.
A city that's not known to sleep,
Those wide open eyes weep.

Some have their hands both bruised,
As whole day their bodies cruised.
Are some of them writhing in pain,
But their efforts to rest are in vain.

As the sun will get up tomorrow,
In the clothes, they had to borrow,
Leaving behind the ache they rise,
Serving the healthy, wealthy and wise.

Apathetic of how the weather is like,
Always are their heads on spike.
Be it rainy or be it sun,
They fight hard for their bun.

Working all day long so hard,
With wages so mere on card.
We can see them all around,
In dark alleys lying on ground.
