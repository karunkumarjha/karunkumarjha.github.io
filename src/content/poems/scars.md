Your skin being the night sky
Bears those countless scars
Tales do we have for them
Just like those twinkling stars

The first one right on the knee
You, then were just two or three
Went straight on a running spree
Slipped your legs, fell like a tree

That one there on your forehead
Got that from the side of a bed
On your bike, in the room, you sped
From the day on, bikes you dread

Scars shape your, body and mind
Just to show, how hard you grind.
Make you look all rough and tough,
Comes with pain, not easy to find.

Scars are stories, forgotten by you.
Some happy, some sad, but all true.
When you tried, those things new,
Gives you smiles, out of the blue.
