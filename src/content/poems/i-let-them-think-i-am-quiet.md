I let them think that I am quiet,
As they rarely hear me speak, right?
Rarely you'll hear my voice
But my thoughts, oh! they make noise.

When I see a girl so cute,
Makes my sound go all mute.
But my mind, steady and stout,
Takes me there to ask her out.

If she gets all mad at me,
Turn around and run in a wee.
Mind's ready with all the maps.
But, surprise, there're no slaps.

I get a nod, along with a smile.
In acceptance, it took a while.
So, this weekend? I ask her.
Alright. She says, in a spur.

As usual, I remain quiet.
But my senses, in a riot.
Feel like dancing in the rain.
Ecstasy surging, in my vein.

And it hit me, then at once
Swiftly like a leopard runs
"Bring your fantasy to an end"
Pulling me to reality, said a friend.
