You have eyes like a shining star
I wonder if, there's a thing at par
Wide open, when they look at me
My heart skips a beat with Glee

When I think of your dusky face
Simple yet has an enigmatic Grace
The way you arch your brows at me
My heart skips a beat with Glee

When you speak your mind out
Soft you look, but thy words stout
The way you let your feelings free
My heart skips a beat with Glee

Every time that I see your smile
Makes me walk you an extra mile
I pray to God, just let it be
My heart skips a beat with Glee

When hair curl down your cheeks
Oh! You pretty, My heart speaks
You put them behind ears I see
My heart skips a beat with Glee

I'll be there through thick and thin
Being the reason for you to grin
You are all I want, just one plea
Keep making my heart skip Beats with Glee
