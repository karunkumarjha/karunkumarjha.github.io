Whenever you are with me
The days are like a gift of bliss
Often we go on laughter spree
You are a blessing to me. O sis!!

When we went to class together
And the days were full of fights
All day long in every weather
Now I miss those lovely delights

And that dance on annual day
How much I wish, I could replay
In my memory, echoes that song
And the steps that you did wrong

And those functions that we hosted
Writing your scripts, I got roasted
Bunked classes and roamed around
Perks of being the hosts, we found

Then we went to different schools
Ways were different, so were rules
And then came that ugly gap
A misunderstanding got us in trap

But then we managed our way out
For love was always pure and stout
I'll be with you, come what it may
From now on, till the doom's day.
