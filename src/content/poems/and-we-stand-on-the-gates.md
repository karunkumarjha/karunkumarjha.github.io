And we stand on the gates of it,
Blank and worried, both a bit.
Covered with clouds, was the sky.
Cluelessness levels, way up high.

Then we entered, into the room.
Nervous like the first night groom.
There they were, sitting all ears.
Leaving behind, worries and fears.

Eyes twinkling, faces with smile.
Making us relaxed, in a while.
And followed the process to greet.
They were all so lively and sweet.

We distributed, the gifts we brought.
A straw and and a soapy water pot.
Joy was the emotion on their face.
Poking the bubbles, we won first race.

And now it was their turn to grind,
The pens on sheets, using their mind.
Right on paper, the hands brought.
Things that they knew and thought.

All were ready on dice, in stance.
As the speakers played the trance,
Nobody waited for their own chance.
Amazing it was, the session of dance.

Despise our pity, they seek friends.
To hold them tight through life's bends.
Notice their faces, the smile it sends.
And when they draw, creativity tends.
