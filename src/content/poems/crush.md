Told my heart that it would go
But towards you, it makes me row
Thought of it as just a crush
But your picture, paints my brush

Such a lovely smile you make
Makes me say, "one more take"
About your sweet and chirpy voice
That's the one I'll hear by choice

To get a glimpse of your face
I'll run each and every race
Nor will I miss a single chance
To look at you and steal a glance

How much I wish that I could say
To hold you close to me everyday
Wanna be the one, that you'll miss
Start and seal my days with a kiss.
