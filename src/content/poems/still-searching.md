Still searching for what is lost
Unaware of its shape and cost
Tried to find it in their eyes
But I failed to get my prize

Something that inspires me like you
Pulls me up and gives me a view
Makes me see the whole world, new
And backs me up, being my crew

Pushes me up, right on the stage
Pulling me out of my comfort cage
Letting me show my utmost rage
Making up for every penny in wage

Then judging me on the way I did
Telling me the highest I could bid
Pointing the errors out on my face
Making sure to strengthen the base

And when all this comes to a break
Putting all the worries at stake
Let's me sleep through the night
So that, with a smiling face I wake.
