Left alone on the street to die.
Notices no one, the tear in my eye.
Close your ears, you may hear me cry,
When I am dead, just come and pry.

Please do tell me, what's my mistake?
What did I do, that my life's at stake
Barely I knew my mom and dad
You took from me, all that I had

All my scars shriek of your deed.
Nothing is left, that I could need.
All you can hear is hue and cry,
My eyes are wet and my throat, dry.

Wounds are bleeding, I'm dying in pain.
I'll be dead, thrown into a drain.
There is something wrong,
I didn't deserve this.
All I ever wanted,
Was dad's hug and mom's kiss.

Never will I ever, meet my friends.
Brutal and sad, the way it ends.
I'll soon have a sister, said my dad.
Now I won't see her, makes me sad.

That's not all that you made me lose.
I am covered in blood and bruise
Even your son could be at my place
Time has come, the right you choose.
