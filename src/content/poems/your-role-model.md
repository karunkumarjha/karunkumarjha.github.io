Time has killed me, real nice and slow
In the past years with the softest blow.
I, now am a pile of flesh
Wounded and bleeding, far from fresh.

Once upon a time we race
When I too, had a cheerful face.
Nothing more could i ask from life,
Oh! I miss those good old days.

Seems like things didn't suit me up.
Nights went dark and days got rough.
All my dears, just forced to part.
Stripped off, of all I had to my heart.

My mind was blank and eyes were blue
Nothing more, that I could lose to
When I came back, dying with thirst
Crawled to a pool when I first saw you.

You had a face just same like mine,
But you were happy as I was dying.
Came a voice from you part of me --
"From all this debris, set your mind free"

You went on as I tried to hear
"Things change, let not your heart fear,
Trust yourself, and hold it tight
Be a man and give it a fight..

Pick yourself up and dust yourself off
Take a stand, you are tough enough"
You vanished as the words ended
I got up with my thoughts all blended.

As I looked around, all was a mess,
Trying to put me back in stress,
But the tables will turn around this time.
For all the havoc, it's a goodbye chime.
