description: "A poem about finding peace in stillness."
---

In the space between heartbeats,
where silence speaks its truth,
I find the gentle whispers
of a long-forgotten youth.

The world spins ever onward,
its chaos never ends,
but here within this quiet,
the broken spirit mends.

A breath, a pause, a moment—
time stretches like the sea,
and in this peaceful stillness,
I finally feel free.

No rush to chase tomorrow,
no weight of yesterday,
just this eternal present,
where all things fade away.

So let me linger longer
in this sacred, quiet space,
where nothing else but being
leaves its gentle trace.
