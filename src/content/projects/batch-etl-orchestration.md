Designed and built a batch ELT platform that processes data from 10+ sources daily. Airflow DAGs orchestrate extraction, dbt handles transformation with tested, documented models, and everything runs on BigQuery.

**Key highlights:**
- Modular dbt models with staging, intermediate, and mart layers
- Data quality checks with dbt tests and Great Expectations
- Infrastructure-as-code with Terraform
- Alerting on SLA breaches and data freshness
