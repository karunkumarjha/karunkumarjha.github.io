Built a data quality framework that plugs into existing pipelines. It runs validation checks, profiles data distributions over time, and surfaces anomalies through Grafana dashboards.

**Key highlights:**
- Schema validation and row-count assertions
- Statistical drift detection on key columns
- Automated alerting for quality regressions
- Historical profiling for trend analysis
