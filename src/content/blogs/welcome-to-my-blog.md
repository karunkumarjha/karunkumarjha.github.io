Welcome to my blog. This is where I write about data engineering — the real stuff. Not just tools and syntax, but the thinking behind building systems that handle data at scale.

## What You'll Find Here

- **System Design** — How to think about data pipelines, batch vs streaming trade-offs, and when "good enough" is the right architecture
- **Deep Dives** — Practical breakdowns of tools like Spark, Airflow, Kafka, and dbt
- **Lessons Learned** — What breaks in production and how to build systems that recover gracefully

## Why I Write

The best way to solidify understanding is to explain it. Writing forces clarity — especially when the topic is something like exactly-once semantics or slowly changing dimensions.
